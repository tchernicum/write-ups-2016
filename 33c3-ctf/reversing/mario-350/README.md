# 33c3 CTF : mario-350

**Category:** Reversing
**Points:** 350
**Solves:** 8
**Description:**

How do you feel about figuring out a really scary beast of a retro console music file?

You are invited to use [the VM we prepared for you](https://archive.aachen.ccc.de/33c3ctf.ccc.ac/uploads/mario-51cd5ebb32ac51b4cd97882e826c113dacfa0aec.ova), which contains a player and the song file.

We cloned game-music-emu from git@bitbucket.org:mpyne/game-music-emu.git, commit 2cbb70f3c27412db7e54ca65fa1a3fac3f6a7d64 to build libgme and gme_player.

If you have an x86_64 Arch Linux, Ubuntu 16.10 or Debian 8.6 desktop, maybe it's enough for you to use [these bundled libraries](mario_standalone.tar.xz), without downloading the full VM. USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK. If it crashes while playing play_me.spc, something is wrong and you should use our VM.
