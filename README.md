There are some problems with [CTF](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) write-ups in general:

* They’re scattered across the interwebs
* They don’t usually include the original files needed to solve the challenge
* Some of them are incomplete or skip ‘obvious’ parts of the explanation, and are therefore not as helpful for newcomers
* Often they disappear when the owner forgets to renew their domain or shuts down their blog

This repository aims to solve those problems.

It’s a collection of CTF source files and write-ups that anyone can contribute to. Did you just publish a CTF write-up? [Let us know](https://github.com/ctfs/write-ups-2016/issues/new), and we’ll add a link to your post — or just add the link yourself and submit a pull request. Spot an issue with a solution?
