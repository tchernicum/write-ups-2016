**Description:**

> Today, unfortunately I must inform you that I am resigning from my position at you company effective immediately. As each day passed by, it became more clear that you do not care about your customers nor your employees. While I may not be able to change your ways, at least I can stop helping you with my expertise.
> I have uploaded all the backups, documents and manuals on [here](https://github.com/ctfs/write-ups-2016/tree/master/asis-ctf-quals-2016/misc/angrymin-52/angrymin) . If you find some other sys-admin stupid enough to work for you, those files are more than enough to help him get started. Meanwhile, I am keeping the username and password for the [firewall](http://juniper.asis-ctf.ir/), just to annoy you.

Would you help this poor boss to find specific username and password?
