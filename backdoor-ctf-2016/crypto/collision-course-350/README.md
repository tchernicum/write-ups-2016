# Backdoor CTF : collision-course-350

**Category:** Crypto
**Points:** 350
**Solves:** 7
**Description:**

> In today's world, hash collisions are becoming more and more popular. That is why, one must rely on standardized hashing techniques, such as bcrypt. However, n00bster shall never learn, and he has implemented his own hash function which he proudly calls foobar. Attached is an implementation of the hash function and a file with which you are supposed to find a collision. He believes that you will not be able to find a collision for the file, especially since he hasn't even given you the hashing algorithm, but has packaged it as a black box application. Prove to him that he is wrong.
