**Category:** Web
**Points:** 25
**Solves:** 314
**Description:**
Wallowing Wallabies provides enterprise contract management - we'd like to find out how easy it is to perform corporate espionage against them. Visit them here <https://wallowing-wallabies.ctfcompetition.com/>.

Please note Please do not run automated scanners against the target - that's not the intended solution. Instead, perhaps look up "xss cookie catching", "xss cookie stealing" and other documents along those lines. Thanks!
