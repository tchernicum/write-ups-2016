**Description:**

> Just saw this on CTFNN, looks like the DNC hired some top notch consulants to fix their cyber problems.  &gt; CTF News Network: So, how can you be sure these servers are secure this time around?  &gt; Consultant:  It took a /long time/ to generate the keys that let you log into them.   &gt; CTF News Network: Wow, thats great. When will they be ready?  &gt; Consultant: Everything's live already\! I did all the work in the past few days\!   &gt; CTF News Network: A true national cyber hero\! We'll have more on this story at 13:37.  Thats as sketch as it gets. Our inside man managed to exfil an ip address of one of the servers, a pubkey, and the libcrypto that was on the box. I bet there's some good stuff on it.    `ssh slowdown@slowdown.pwn.democrat`    [id_rsa](<https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackthevote/id_rsa.8f413ca1bdcd5bbfc3455195ddddaaf>â€¦.so.1.0.0.12e54c010aef4ee5464b25863e68f4c9e6f47c0adecfd11a96c0aae3f9c68626)    author's irc nick: Unix-Dude    Hint: The consultant saw the earliest hours of November while rushing to finish his project on time. Also, no more than 1500 loops, you'll get it when you get there.
