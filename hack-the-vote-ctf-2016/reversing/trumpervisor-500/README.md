**Description:**

> We found a flash drive on the floor today. The flash drive had this binary on it and a text file that said 'Make Virtualization Great Again\!' Naturally, we need someone to look into this. These files are way too suspicious to overlook, especially this close to the election. Can you tell us what this binary is doing?  `nc trumpervisor.pwn.republican 9000`    [Trumpervisor](<https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackthevote/Trumpervisor.bf38753e7bfc93d1bbf9aee6aa6dbdcd39d2ccd31f1547253a75209419f0828a.sys)>    author's irc nick: Aidielse
