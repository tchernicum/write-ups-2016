**Description:**

> Somebody broke into Kentucky's voter registration system last week but the officials are only saying that they patched it instead of saying who it was. Can you find a new way into their management system and identify the attacker? After registration closes, the site will be taken offline so don't miss your chance.  Note: This challenge uses a slightly nonstandard flag format    <http://kentucky.pwn.republican>    Hint: You should look at this challenge soon before it is too late\! Draft your solution asap.  author's irc nick: itszn
