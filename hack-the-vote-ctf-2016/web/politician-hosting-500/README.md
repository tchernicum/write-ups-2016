> So what if she leaked some emails. I'm sure trump has done things like that. In fact with his recent security briefings, he might have some juicy secrets to misplace. He's been using that hosting and dns service aimed at raising politicians. Knowing how messy his businesses are, he must have something stuffed away on his web server. You probably won't find it unless you gain access to his control panel.  <https://voteforme.hosting.pwn.republican>    Update: A config file was left from testing, it was not relevant. The IP 104.131.213.67 is not in scope, do not attack it.    author's irc nick: itszn
