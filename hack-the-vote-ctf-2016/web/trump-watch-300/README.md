**Description:**

> I think we have found an alt-right hotspot, in this blog which covers Trumps operations. Our reports show that they have been attacked a few times, and had their databases dropped. They seem to have beefed up security, but the admin still probably has some access to some interesting details.   <http://watch.pwn.republican>    Hint 1: Google is good at cracking hashes  Hint 2: /database.sql  No off the shelf automated tools are needed, try not to spam them or you will get banned    author's irc nick: itszn
