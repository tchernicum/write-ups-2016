# Hack the Vote CTF 2016 : voter-registration-200

**Category:** Web

**Description:**

> Trump is up quite a bit in Kansas, but with other historically red states (like Arizona) shifting sides, I think we can take this. Just takes a little voter fraud. Our target is the voter registration site, it looks like it is from the 90s, so it might be super vulnerable. If you can register a bunch of our people, we can bus them out and get them to vote for Clinton.  <http://kansas.pwn.republican>    Clarification: You only need to get the flag, not necessarily registering a bunch of accounts.    No Automated tools are needed, try not to spam them or you will get banned  author's irc nick: itszn
