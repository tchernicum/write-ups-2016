**Description:**

> Let's face it, you've been the bad guy all along. And, to be honest, who doesn't crave for some R'lyehlsque world oder? Well, don't wait for Cthulhu's call. Call Him yourself! Get mad! "I'm not waiting for you to finish your endless slumber, how long the hell am I supposed to wait? I demand to see Cthulhu!", you cry out. Well, this didn't quite work, but I'm sure you're going to figure out the correct phrase, eventually.

## Hint

To avoid frustration in the long run: Boolector works fine on these constraints, use a charset from 0x27 to 0x79. Further check via MD5.
