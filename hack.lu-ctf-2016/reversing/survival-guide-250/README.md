**Description:**

> While wandering alongside the beach, you spot an unknown object in the distance. Wondering what it might be, you go closer and realise that it's a scroll. In clear letters it's For in strange aeons, when death has died... written on it.  This sounds somewhat familiar and Cthulhu related. Could it be that there is more hidden inside this scroll than just the beginning of this sentence? Maybe even instruction how to survive when Cthulhu awakens?
