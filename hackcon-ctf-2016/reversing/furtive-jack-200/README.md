**Description:**

Jack is working for a secret organisation, planning something destructive for the city. Luckily, Samby has followed Jack in attempts to crack his organisation's password system. Samby has gathered that the password system takes the employee number and returns the password of the employee. He has also gathered the working of the password system and sending you an implementation of it.

We know Jack's employee number is 669291813 but we're unable to get his password. The flag is the SHA-1 of Jack's password.
