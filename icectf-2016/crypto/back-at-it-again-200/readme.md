# IceCTF-2016 : back-at-it-again-200

**Category:** Crypto
**Points:** 200
**Description:**

Steve's back at it again with them keys! Can you get it this time? He cleaned up his broken keys on GitHub from last year, but didn't replace them. He must have shared them somehow with a friend, who gave him an account at shell.icec.tf. Can you get access?
