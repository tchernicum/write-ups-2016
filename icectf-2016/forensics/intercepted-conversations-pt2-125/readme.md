# IceCTF-2016 : intercepted-conversations-pt2-125

**Category:** Forensics
**Points:** 125
**Description:**

We managed to intercept more of the hacker's traffic, unfortunately since our last encounter they have figured out that they're being watched. They've gotten more clever in their communication so we need you to try to make sense of this traffic.
