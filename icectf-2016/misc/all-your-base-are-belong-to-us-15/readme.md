# IceCTF-2016 : all-your-base-are-belong-to-us-15

**Category:** Misc
**Points:** 15
**Description:**

What a mess... we got a raw flag but now what do we do...

## Writeup

Looking at the flag, it contains only zeros and ones, pointing towards binary. Using an online binary to ASCII converter (or a Python script like rawsec). The ASCII result is the flag: `IceCTF{al1_my_bases_are_yours_and_all_y0ur_bases_are_mine}`
