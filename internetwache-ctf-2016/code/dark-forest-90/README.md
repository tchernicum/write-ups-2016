# Internetwache CTF 2016 : Dark Forest

**Category:** Code
**Points:** 90
**Solves:** 69
**Description:**

> Description: Someone pre-ordered a forest and now I'm lost in it. There are a lot of binary trees in front and behind of me. Some are smaller or equal-sized than others. Can you help me to invert the path and find out of the forest? Hint: It's about (inverted) BSTs. Don't forget the spaces.
