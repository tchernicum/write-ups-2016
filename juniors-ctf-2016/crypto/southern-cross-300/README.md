> - It's the Confederacy's cipher disk with a help of which southerners encrypted their messages.
>
> - How does it work?
>
> - Look, Dipper. We need to encode the phrase MABLE EATS SPRINKLES. We don't need any spaces so just delete them. We get MABLEEATSSPRINKLES. Then we have too choose a key. Let it be GRAVITY. And let's go !!!

> You see, we've encrypted the phrase and here it is RBZTXYZJSKZBLQCEN
>
> - Cool!
>
> - Now I'll encode a famous story and you'll try to decode it. By the way, it's much more interesting to read the whole story over, isn't it?
>
> ....
>
> - That's complicated. Maybe I have to find a key at first. I'd better look for someone who is able to solve this...
