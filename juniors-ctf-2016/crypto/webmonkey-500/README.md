> - I'm developing a website for Gruncle, Mabel. Actually I've already made it. It's only left to send it to the provider.

> - Give me a look... Wow, cool. It even has a flag. But if gnomes find the flag, they may come back. I'm afraid, Dipper.
>
> - Don't be scared. Along with the web-site I've developed a super encoding program. I'll encrypt every file so that gnomes won't understand anything.
