Opening the image leads us to see multiple characters that are not of any langauge set, but once we google one of them cropped from the picture we are led to [Bill's Cipher from Gravity Falls](http://gravityfalls.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_cryptograms#Bill.27s_symbol_substitution_cipher).

It a simple substition cipher where you match the character with their corresponding English counterparts.
