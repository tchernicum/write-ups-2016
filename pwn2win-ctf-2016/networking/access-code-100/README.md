**Category:** Networking
**Points:** 100
**Solves:**
**Description:**
SkySoldier86 analyzed the leaked e-mails from the Hacking Team, and has found out that the Club has hired them back in 2014 to develop a new authentication system to their secret servers, Method based in client/server. We managed to access the ‘prototype’ of the server, that apparently it’s finished, but not the client. Your mission is to unveil how it works, for it will be very useful in the future.
