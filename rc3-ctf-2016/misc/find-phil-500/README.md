> During the great battle of IRSEC 2015 we lost a great man, Phil. The blue teams fought effortlessly to keep him save but sadly they did not stand a chance against their attackers. Since losing him in that great battle our team has been searching tirelessly for Phil. Recently, we received credible intelligence that this team recruits new members by putting them through a series of challenges. The challenge starts with this file. It is your job to join their organization, and find Phil. Bring him home safe.
