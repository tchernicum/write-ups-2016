**Description:**

> We have received a portable asymmetric key storage for evaluation purposes. This portable device was manufactured by Ebian Corp to facilitate secure communications with customers. It generates and stores adminstrators' public keys. Customers can use this repository to find the public key of the admin they want to contact, and administrators can use this repository to update their key information. If this fancy keychain passes the test we are going to give them away like candy, secure candy.
