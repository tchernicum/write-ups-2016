**Description:**

> We have recently been informed that a group of hackers exploited a vulnerability in a PC within another very secure network. Our operative says the hacker in charge took a snapshot of the password, which they stored in their secret hidden-away database.
> 
> 
> Today we found a photo manager service running on the internet. This service can be linked to the hacker who retrieved the passwords. From the size of the photo manager we can see they stored lots of pictures, so we are hoping they stored the password on their photo manager too. Can you breach their photo manager and take a quick look?
