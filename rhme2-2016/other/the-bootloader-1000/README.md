**Description:**

> So, daredevil, are you ready for a real challenge? The security of this CTF depends on the bootloader, so we tried to make it as secure as possible within the limitations of our target board (which isn't exactly designed to provide a secure platform). However, it has limitations and we learned the hard way about some of them.

> Instead of ruining the fun of everybody when somebody pwns our bootloader and publishes how he did it, we decided to make our bootloader the last target of this CTF. You solved this last challenge when you extract your personal private key, with any means necessary. FI, SCA or software exploitation, everything is allowed. The only thing is that you cannot use this to solve the other challenges and you can not publish about it until the CTF is over. Then we would love to hear how you did it and feel free to share it with the world.

> Keep in mind that messing with the bootloader will be risky. If you brick break your Arduino the game is over. Hence, you should hack the bootloader after you are done with the challenges.
