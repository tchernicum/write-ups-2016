> We have found this binary in an abandoned building. The police suspect someone set the building on fire by accident but we KNOW it was arson. Someone was trying to hide a secret plan of attack against the Republic of Wadiya. We think the binary contains the key to a safe that we were able to recover. Reverse the binary and help us find the secret key. You can be the hero we know you are!
