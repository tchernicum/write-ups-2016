# sCTF 2016 Q1 : deblink-100

**Category:** Algorithmic
**Points:** 100
**Solves:** 10
**Description:**

You have a device that is nearly completely bricked, but it seems to progress to a stage in boot where you can run your own code, and it conveniently has 8 LEDs. You write a small binary to read the bootlog and emit it, compressed, byte-by-byte on the LEDs. With a phone camera and a shaky hand, you record the LEDs.

Decode the video.
