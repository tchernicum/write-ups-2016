**Description:**

> I was working when my boss called and reported a ransomeware attack!  We were lucky, as we had our honeypot memory-dump during attack. Well, not as lucky as others who are not victims!  Hint: Murphy's law on memory forensics: If you start looking for encrypted files from the beginning of the malware memory, you'll end up finding them at the end of it :) [Download](<http://ctf.sharif.edu/ctf7/api/download/22)>
